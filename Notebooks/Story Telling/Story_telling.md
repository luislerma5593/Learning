# Story Telling

## General

* Communicating with stories, not just facts. For example, the story of the school friend (eating apples) which was in poverty (20% of children live in poverty in USA).
	* This activates more part of the brain and will make it more "memorable".

* Most effective when there are interactions (reader-driven story telling).

* Story telling introduce and then resolve anxiety. Make sure to introduce neural words (apple)

## Story structure

### KWYs

* KWYRWTS - Know what you really want to say
	* What are the nost important ideas you want to communicate?

* KWYDIS - Know what your data is saying
	* Understand data to communicate it

* KWYANTH - Know what your audience needs to hear
	* Understand them, detail they need, time they need 

### Story components

There are four components:
* Plot: how story unfolds
* Protagonist: the main character
* Problem: a difficult goal for the protagonist
* Transformation the "so-what": how the protagonist changes as a result.


Marvel example: Try to play around with the data, and you will be finding patterns sooner or later, also use visualizations.

Think in terms of a story when analyzing data.

Tips for Data Analysts:
* What questions are you asking?
* What answers are you finding?
* What story does this tell you?

Outline the story:
* Divide the structure of the story into containers of content, then order it.
* To find out what's missing in the story
* Get the central idea


Tell story out loud:
* Confirm is logical
* Prove it flows (linear flow)
* Figure out next level of details

Now is the sketching part:
* Recommended to use the hans and draw
* Try to design the pages and the visualzations that will be used
* Imagine different ways
* Organize story structure
* Take notes and capture ideas

## Story mechanisms

* Change over time
* Linear logic
* Flow diagrams
* Compare and contrast
* Progressive depth
* Personalization
* Test
 
## Final touches

* Repetition and redundancy
	* Message
	* Data
	* Visual cue

# Story telling: Best Practices

* Choose the correct visualization, depending on the audience. For example:
	* Bar charts can be for everyone
	* Scatter plots can be for some people
	* Box plots are for people that know about statistics
	
* Key questions
	1. Who is your audience?
	2. What are your objectives?
	3. What data will serve your objective?
		* Don't use unnecessary data 
	4. What chart or graph is best?
	
* Data Viz Mistakes to Avoid
	* Putting FORM over FUNCTION

* In practice
	* Don't label everthing, just what you want to tell
	* Add legends in-line if possible
	* Use colors for what you want to show. Don't color everything
	* Grid only if necessary
	* In barcharts, always start y-axis in 0. With lineplots, could begin different than 0
