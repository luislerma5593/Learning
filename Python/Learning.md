__init__


The __init__ method is the most important method in a class.
This is called when an instance (object) of the class is created, using the class name as a function.

All methods must have self as their first parameter, although it isn't explicitly passed, Python adds the self argument to the list for you; you do not need to include it when you call the methods. Within a method definition, self refers to the instance calling the method.

Instances of a class have attributes, which are pieces of data associated with them.
In this example, Cat instances have attributes color and legs. These can be accessed by putting a dot, and the attribute name after an instance.
In an __init__ method, self.attribute can therefore be used to set the initial value of an instance's attributes.
