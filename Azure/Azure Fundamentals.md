# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## Cloud Concepts

Services provided by cloud providers:

Basic
	1. Computer Power (You pay what you use, so it saves on costs)
	2. Storage (Request as much as you need)
	
### Shared responsability

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). 
- IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
- SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. 
- PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.
