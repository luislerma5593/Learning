# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals

## Cloud Concepts

Services provided by cloud providers:

Basic
	1. Computer Power (You pay what you use, so it saves on costs)
	2. Storage (Request as much as you need)
	
### Shared responsability

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). 
- IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity.
- SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. 
- PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.
	
### Cloud models

1. Private
2. Public
3. Hybrid
	
### Benefits of cloud

- High availability (SLA: Service Level Agreement)
	- Not 100% because it needs time to backup, maintenance, etc.
	- In azure from 99% to 99.9% depending on the service

- Scalability: Increase or decrease and pay what you use
	- Horizontal: De/Increasing number of resources (Virtual Machines)
	- Vertical: De/Increasing capabilities of resources (CPU or RAM)
	
- Reliability: The ability to recover from failures

- Predictability: Predicts cost and performance depending on historical data

- Security: Allows to choose the security level, depending on IaaS, PaaS, SaaS.
	- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, making your network more robust and secure.

- Manageability 
	- Of the cloud: Resources
	- In the cloud: Like command interface or API
	
### Service Types

- IaaS: You’re essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter

- PaaS: Is a middle ground between renting space in a datacenter and paying for a complete and deployed solution.

- SaaS: You’re essentially renting or using a fully developed application
